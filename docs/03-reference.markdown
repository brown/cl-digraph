## Package `DIGRAPH`

### `ARBITRARY-VERTEX` (function)

    (ARBITRARY-VERTEX DIGRAPH)

Return an arbitrary vertex of `digraph` and `t`.

  If the digraph is empty, `(values nil nil)` will be returned instead.

  

### `CONTAINS-EDGE-P` (function)

    (CONTAINS-EDGE-P DIGRAPH PREDECESSOR SUCCESSOR)

Return whether the graph contains an edge from `predecessor` to `successor`.

### `CONTAINS-VERTEX-P` (function)

    (CONTAINS-VERTEX-P DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return whether the graph contains `vertex`.

### `COPY-DIGRAPH` (function)

    (COPY-DIGRAPH DIGRAPH)

Create a fresh copy of `digraph`.

  The vertex objects themselves are not copied, but everything else is.

  

### `COUNT-EDGES` (function)

    (COUNT-EDGES DIGRAPH)

Return the number of edges in `digraph`.

### `COUNT-VERTICES` (function)

    (COUNT-VERTICES DIGRAPH)

Return the number of vertices in `digraph`.

### `DEGREE` (function)

    (DEGREE DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return the number of neighbors of `vertex`.

### `DEGREE-IN` (function)

    (DEGREE-IN DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return the number of predecessors of `vertex`.

### `DEGREE-OUT` (function)

    (DEGREE-OUT DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return the number of successors of `vertex`.

### `DIGRAPH` (class)

A directed graph.  Use `make-digraph` to create one.

### `DIGRAPH-ERROR` (class)

Base condition for digraph-related errors.

### `EDGES` (function)

    (EDGES DIGRAPH)

Return a fresh list of the edges of `digraph`.

  Each edge will be a cons of the form `(predecessor . successor)`.

  

### `EMPTYP` (function)

    (EMPTYP DIGRAPH)

Return `t` if `digraph` has no vertices or edges, `nil` otherwise.

### `INSERT-EDGE` (function)

    (INSERT-EDGE DIGRAPH PREDECESSOR SUCCESSOR)

Insert an edge from `predecessor` to `successor` if not already present.

  Returns `t` if the edge was already in the graph, or `nil` if it was
  inserted.

  The `predecessor` and `successor` vertices must already exist in the graph.
  If `predecessor` is not in the graph a `missing-predecessor` error will be
  signaled.  Otherwise, if `successor` is not in the graph, a `missing-successor`
  error will be signaled.

  

### `INSERT-VERTEX` (function)

    (INSERT-VERTEX DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Insert `vertex` into the graph if it is not already a member.

  Returns `t` if the vertex was already in the graph, or `nil` if it was
  inserted.

  

### `LEAFP` (function)

    (LEAFP DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return whether `vertex` is a leaf vertex in `digraph`.

### `LEAFS` (function)

    (LEAFS DIGRAPH)

Return all leaf vertices in `digraph`.

  This is currently O(vertices).

  A root is a vertex with no outgoing edges (i.e. out-degree 0).

  

### `MAKE-DIGRAPH` (function)

    (MAKE-DIGRAPH &KEY INITIAL-VERTICES (TEST #'EQL) (HASH-FUNCTION NIL))

Create and return a new digraph.

  `initial-vertices` can be a sequence of vertices to add to the graph.

  `test` should be one of the hash table equality predicates.

  If your Lisp implementation supports the `:hash-function` argument for
  creating hash tables with custom predicates, you can specify one with
  `hash-function`.

  

### `MAP-BREADTH-FIRST` (function)

    (MAP-BREADTH-FIRST FUNCTION DIGRAPH START-VERTEX)

Apply `function` to the vertices of a breadth-first traversal of `digraph`.

  Returns a fresh list with the results.

  Vertices are processed in breadth-first order, beginning at `start-vertex`,
  and the resulting list has this order as well.

  Cycles in the graph will not be traversed into.

  

### `MAP-DEPTH-FIRST` (function)

    (MAP-DEPTH-FIRST FUNCTION DIGRAPH START-VERTEX)

Apply `function` to the vertices of a breadth-first traversal of `digraph`.

  Returns a fresh list with the results.

  Vertices are processed in depth-first order, beginning at `start-vertex`, and
  the resulting list has this order as well.

  Cycles in the graph will not be traversed into.

  

### `MAP-EDGES` (function)

    (MAP-EDGES FUNCTION DIGRAPH)

Return a fresh list with the results of calling `function` on each edge.

  For each edge, `function` will be called once with two arguments:

    (function predecessor successor)

  The order of the resulting list is unspecified.

  

### `MAP-VERTICES` (function)

    (MAP-VERTICES FUNCTION DIGRAPH)

Return a fresh list with the results of calling `function` on each vertex.

  The order of the resulting list is unspecified.

  

### `MAPC-BREADTH-FIRST` (function)

    (MAPC-BREADTH-FIRST FUNCTION DIGRAPH START-VERTEX)

Apply `function` to the vertices of a breadth-first traversal of `digraph`.

  Returns `nil`.

  Vertices are processed in breadth-first order, beginning at `start-vertex`.

  Cycles in the graph will not be traversed into.

  

### `MAPC-DEPTH-FIRST` (function)

    (MAPC-DEPTH-FIRST FUNCTION DIGRAPH START-VERTEX)

Apply `function` to the vertices of a depth-first traversal of `digraph`.

  Returns `nil`.

  Vertices are processed in depth-first order, beginning at `start-vertex`.

  Cycles in the graph will not be traversed into.

  

### `MAPC-EDGES` (function)

    (MAPC-EDGES FUNCTION DIGRAPH)

Call `function` on each edge in `digraph`.

  For each edge, `function` will be called once with two arguments:

    (function predecessor successor)

  The order in which the edges are processed is unspecified.

  Returns `nil`.

  

### `MAPC-VERTICES` (function)

    (MAPC-VERTICES FUNCTION DIGRAPH)

Call `function` on each vertex in `digraph`.

  The order in which the vertices are processed is unspecified.

  Returns `nil`.

  

### `MISSING-PREDECESSOR` (class)

An error signaled when trying to insert an edge whose predecessor is not in the graph.

   `vertex-involved` can be used to retrieve the offending predecessor.

### `MISSING-SUCCESSOR` (class)

An error signaled when trying to insert an edge whose successor is not in the graph.

   `vertex-involved` can be used to retrieve the offending successor.

### `MISSING-VERTEX` (class)

Base condition for errors signaled when inserting an edge with a vertex missing.

### `NEIGHBORS` (function)

    (NEIGHBORS DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return a fresh list of the neighbors of `vertex`.

### `PREDECESSORS` (function)

    (PREDECESSORS DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return a fresh list of the predecessors of `vertex`.

### `REACHABLEP` (function)

    (REACHABLEP DIGRAPH START TARGET &KEY (STRATEGY :BREADTH-FIRST))

Return `t` if it is possible to reach `target` from `start`, otherwise `nil`.

  All vertices are reachable from themselves.

  Otherwise a `target` is reachable from `start` if a directed path exists from
  the start to the target.

  `strategy` will be used to determine how to traverse the graph when searching
  for a path, and can be one of `:breadth-first` or `:depth-first`.

  

### `REMOVE-EDGE` (function)

    (REMOVE-EDGE DIGRAPH PREDECESSOR SUCCESSOR)

Remove an edge from `predecessor` to `successor` if present.

  Returns `t` if there was such an edge, or `nil` if not.

  

### `REMOVE-VERTEX` (function)

    (REMOVE-VERTEX DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Remove `vertex` from the graph if present.

  If there are any edges to/from `vertex` they will be automatically removed.

  Returns `t` if there was such a vertex, or `nil` if not.

  

### `ROOTP` (function)

    (ROOTP DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return whether `vertex` is a root vertex in `digraph`.

### `ROOTS` (function)

    (ROOTS DIGRAPH)

Return all root vertices in `digraph`.

  This is currently O(vertices).

  A root is a vertex with no incoming edges (i.e. in-degree 0).

  

### `SUCCESSORS` (function)

    (SUCCESSORS DIGRAPH VERTEX)

Return a fresh list of the successors of `vertex`.

### `TOPOLOGICAL-SORT` (function)

    (TOPOLOGICAL-SORT DIGRAPH)

Return a fresh list of the vertices of `digraph` in topological order.

  Edges are treated as meaning "depends on", so an edge `A --> B` means "A
  depends on B" and that B must come before A in the resulting list.  Aside
  from this restriction, the order of the resulting list is arbitrary.

  The order in which the vertices are processed is unspecified.

  A `topological-sort-cycle` error will be signaled if the graph contains
  a cycle.

  

### `TOPOLOGICAL-SORT-CYCLE` (class)

An error signaled when topologically sorting a graph that contains a cycle.

   `vertex-involved` can be used to retrieve one of the vertices involved in a
   cycle.  Which vertex in the cycle is chosen is arbitrary.

### `VERTEX-INVOLVED` (generic function)

    (VERTEX-INVOLVED CONDITION)

Retrieve the vertex involved in the condition.

### `VERTICES` (function)

    (VERTICES DIGRAPH)

Return a fresh list of the vertices of `digraph`.
